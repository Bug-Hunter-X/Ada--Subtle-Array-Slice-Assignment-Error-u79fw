This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in Ada programming related to array slice assignments, specifically when involving subtypes. The `bug.ada` file contains code exhibiting this error.  The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version and explains the necessary adjustments to avoid the issue.  The problem lies in the implicit subtype conversion and how the compiler handles assigning a slice of one array to another array which might have a different subtype.  Understanding these intricacies is crucial for writing robust and error-free Ada code.
